## Functions  

- User is prompted to press enter.
- Game starts once user presses enter on their keyboard.
- There are 4 different colored boxes in which one is randomly selected to flash once per level.
- The player starts at level 1 and levels up when he repeats the sequence correctly.
- If the player clicks incorrectly, the game will end.
- When the game ends the user will be shown a textbox with a prompt to type in his name.
- If a name is entered and the user clicks submit the name and highest level reached will be sent to a database.
- The database arranges the data by descending order of level.
- Only the first 5 data in the database is kept.
